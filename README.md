   DevourMenu is a Cheat Menu for the Game DEVOUR.
</p>

## Disclaimer
This project is for Educational Use only. We do not condone this software being used to gain an advantage against other people. I made this project for my university project to show how cheating software works and how it is possible to block these manipulations in the future.

## Compile (Configurations)
You can compile two different versions of the menu. Normal or Version Proxy.

### Normal (DevourMenu.dll)
Inject it with any injector you have.

- Debug (With Debug Information and can be attached to process)
- Release (Optimized with all information stripped)

### Version Proxy (version.dll)
Will automatically be loaded by the Game itself if the dll is in the game directory.

- Debug_Version (With Debug Information and can be attached to process)
- Release_Version (Optimized with all information stripped)

### Default Hotkeys
- Show Menu - DELETE
